# Starship Racer

---

Imagine the vast emptiness of space, now create a racetrack. What would you bring to the race.

Welcome to Starship Racer. The blockade runners have defined the ships that could our run, out fight, and get the goods 
to the surface. Pilot and mechanic must keep their Starship in top shape if they are going to make it to the finish line 
in this race.

You will be leaving planets under momentum disabling guns. Navigate the Asteroid belts to get to the out jump zones. 
Find your way through the dangers of hyperspace, and be the first to land at the finish line. 

Caution trying to smuggle anything during these races, the custom officers now your coming. Get by them with some 
contra-band could really make that prize purse with it all.

Good luck Racer. Keep it together and you could become the next Racing Ace.
